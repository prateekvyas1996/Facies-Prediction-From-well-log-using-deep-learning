# Facies Prediction from Well log using Deep Learning

In this project I tries to train CNN (convolutional neural network), RNN (Recurrent neural networks) to predict the litho facies from the available lithofacies data.
There is a notebook which contains code and also the repository contain data, you can run this code in Kaggle environment also by adjusting the code and also can change the network and retrain the network.

Open the well_log.ipyb file, it is a notebook containing code to train the model.
